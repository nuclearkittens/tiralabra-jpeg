# WEEKLY REPORT 1 & 2

Aight, not a strong start for me, completely missing the first deadline and almost the second one, too. Only have myself to blame et cetera, et cetera. Onwards & upwards.

## Project progress

Okay, so there is no code as of yet (Fri Nov 11th) – we'll see if that changes tomorrow. However, the repository is set up, dependencies have been added, the topic has been chosen.

Mostly been reading about JPEG compression (I had some basic knowledge on this topic as I have done some image editing on MATLAB and even more on Photoshop – so why not familiarise myself with the maths behind it).

## This week I learnt...

I am absolutely zero percent sure if I want to stick with this topic. Don't get me wrong, I am interested and want to learn, just wondering whether I have bitten too much and can't quite chew it, haha.

In all seriousness, as mentioned before, most of the time this week has been spent reading on DCT and FFT and whatnot, plus re-familiarising myself with converting images from one colour space to another. Regretfully I have not started the actual coding yet, but will do ASAP. As in, tomorrow. Saturday. The Deadline Day.

## Questions, problems, and such

Is NumPy allowed for arrays (matrices), or do I have to implement the matrix operations and such using nested lists? Is the scope of the project manageable (I mean, yes, it was on the example topics, just seems a bit much and I know myself to be too ambitious at times)?

Is there anything specific I should consider what comes to testing? I do not have much experience working with images on Python so that will likely cause me to grow some grey hairs as well.

## What next?

Writing the actual code. I suppose I'll start with the RGB-YCbCr transformation, subsampling, and splitting the image data into blocks before worrying about DCT and Huffman.

Oh yeah, and better time management is priority number one.
