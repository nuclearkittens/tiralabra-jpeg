# WEEKLY REPORT 5

I've been so lazy this week â€“ at least it feels like it. Had a bit of a flu in the beginning of the week, essay deadlines, and some non-negotiable social events to attend later in the week, so this project has been somewhat neglected during the week.

## Project progress

Not a lot of progress this week, which is slightly disappointing. Took some time writing the code review, plus resolving issues that were mentioned in mine. Additionally, the project structure was getting out of hand, so most of the time this week has been used for restructuring (i.e., not a lot of new content).

For ease of use, I wrote a simple command line UI to run the application. Currently, it is not fully functional, but runs the example up until chroma subsampling.

Unit tests are still lacking (and there is no testing report yet, sorry). Currently trying to understand what is happening in the block module, as I have definitely messed up the padding somehow ':D'

## This week I learnt...

Code review was good, has been a while since I have not just read but also commented someone else's code.

## Questions, problems, and such

Everything is a problem ahaha. Jk, I know I am a bit behind but not feeling overwhelmed anymore at least. I'm gonna figure this out.

## What next?

Get the block module to work (yes, still working on that), testing & documentation,  and. Then. Finally DCT.
