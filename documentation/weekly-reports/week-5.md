# WEEKLY REPORT 5

I've been so lazy this week â€“ at least it feels like it. Had a bit of a flu in the beginning of the week, essay deadlines, and some non-negotiable social events to attend later in the week, so this project has been somewhat neglected during the week.

## Project progress

Not a lot of progress this week, which is slightly disappointing. Took some time writing the code review, plus resolving issues that were mentioned in mine. Additionally, the project structure was getting out of hand, so most of the time this week has been used for restructuring (i.e., not a lot of new content).

For ease of use, I wrote a simple command line UI to run the application. Currently, it is not fully functional, but runs the example up until chroma subsampling. Weirdly enough, I'm getting better results for the 2D convolution based subsampling now, and I have no idea why that is happening?
