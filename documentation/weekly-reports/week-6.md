# WEEKLY REPORT 5

To be completely honest, I was very much ready to drop the whole course and abandon this project. So I guess it is no wonder I am still behind.

## Project progress

Been figuring out the problems in the Block module and (almost) finished the unit tests for it. Wrote utility functions for DCT, FFT, and the like, although the inverse functions are still missing.

## This week I learnt...

Linear algebra, I guess. And how big of a difference optimising actually does.

## Questions, problems, and such

I am the problem. No, really. No need to inform me I have not done enough or that I'm running out of time. I *know*, I am very aware of this. Although, examples of testing documents would be appreciated.

## What next?

Everything that is missing. Think I am going to skip the decoding part and actually saving to JPEG (I understand absolutely nothing of the markers and such). That still leaves me with Huffman and run-length encoding, plus all the documentation.
