# WEEKLY REPORT 3

I feel like I've spent more time planning than actually coding this week. Dunno why it seems so difficult to Create Something. Like, this seems way beyond my skills and knowledge. 

## Project progress

It has been a slow start â€“ more time has been used to do research than writing code. The first issue, although simple at heart, took me ages to overcome: if I'm making a JPEG converter, what is (/are) the file format(/s) I am converting *from*?

So, as a photographer, I mainly work with RAW images (namely, CR2). RAW images tend to be camera or software specific, and who wants to convert those into JPEGs anyway? JPEG being a raster graphic, there would be no point considering vector graphics, really, so that already excludes several formats. TIFF is a nice lossless format I tend to use for the high-quality prints anyway, and also widely used for raster graphics. Thus, I will focus on TIFF to JPEG conversions here.

Secondly, the RBG to YCbCr conversion took way more time than I thought. My linear algebra is rusty, so matrix revision was needed, as well as time for understanding the conversion formulas.
